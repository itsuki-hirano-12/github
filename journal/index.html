                An overlay is used to display contents on top of a page without moving to a different page. Here are some of the practices to follow when using overlays:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Make it obvious to the user how to close the overlay</li>
                <li>Make the overlay standout from the background by making the box smaller or blurring the background</li>
                <li>Enable escape key to close the overlay</li>
            </ol>

            <p>It's also important to think about the target audience when using overlays as well. Are they accessing the site from desktop or mobile? Is the overlay used just to inform the user, or is the user going to interact with the overlay? Is the overlay going to be opened by the user at will, or will open automatically? Where will the overlay be placed? Just as any other element in interactive design, the most important practice is to think about the user first.</p>

                There are a number of practices to follow when creating a form like minimizing the number of questions, making it clear how many steps there are, or having feedback after submission. These are great user-friendly tips as I start to work with forms in my web design, because I think that they are all elements that would make my experience less agonizing if I were to fill out the form myself. Thinking the other way around, the things that I would find annoying when filling out forms are the things that I should avoid when creating my own form. I may not think much about the details in design when I fill out a form, but there are many things that I should consider to help make the user experience better.

            <p>A website that I fill out forms pretty often on is <a href="https://battlefy.com/">Battlefy</a>, and I use this site to sign up for tournaments. The tournament sign up forms on this site clears the check-boxes for the form design practices like asking a minimum number of questions necessary, using a single column, and confirming submission at the end by taking you to the tournament homepage showing that you're signed up.</p>
