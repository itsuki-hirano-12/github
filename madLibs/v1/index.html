        <h2>Here is Your Race!</h2>
        <p>
            I entered my pet <span>lion</span> in a race. I gave him his favorite treat, <span>apples</span> to hype him up before the race. He was very excited to race against his rival, <span>zebra</span>. The race is <span>100 miles</span> long, and this is the longest race he had ever participated in so I was worried.
            The race started and everyone's pets started running <span>furiously</span> to the goal. My <span>lion</span> struggled at the start but began to catch up. He went ahead of his rival <span>zebra</span> at the last second!.
            My <span>lion</span> crossed the finish line and looked <span>happy</span> in the end. He won <span>1st</span> place, and got a <span>shiny</span> trophy.
